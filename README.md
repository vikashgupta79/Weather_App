WeatherTrack – Real-Time Weather Monitoring App WeatherTrack is a real-time weather monitoring web application 🌍 built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to search for any city and instantly view live weather conditions through a clean and intuitive interface 🖥️📱.

By integrating a weather API 🌐, the application fetches up-to-date data and displays key weather details such as current temperature 🌡️, weather conditions ☀️🌧️, humidity 💧, and wind speed 🌬️. The search functionality provides quick results without page reloads, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

The UI is designed with a modern, responsive layout 🎨 that adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The application also includes error handling ⚠️, displaying clear messages when an invalid city name is entered, which improves usability and reliability.

JavaScript plays a crucial role in handling API requests 🔄, asynchronous data fetching, and DOM manipulation, while CSS enhances the visual appeal using gradients, hover effects, and structured components ✨. HTML provides a semantic and well-organized structure for the app.

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of API integration 📡, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch), responsive web design 📐, and interactive UI development. WeatherTrack is ideal for beginners and students aiming to strengthen their frontend development skills 💻 and understand how real-time data-driven applications function.

Overall, WeatherTrack showcases how core web technologies can be combined to build an efficient, interactive, and visually engaging weather application 🌟.
